# Lopy-Nanogatway-USA
Create a Lopy Nanogateway to The Things Network and setup a Node

I would like to share the code after Going through a lot and finally nailing it down to setup the Nanogateway on TTN US.

We will setup a LoPy as the Gateway to TTN and other LoPy as a Node using ABP authentication.

Follow the guide on my [Blog](https://seasluglabs.io/blogs/guides/the-things-network-us-setup-with-lopy-as-a-nano-gateway-and-lopy-node)  and keep supporting us by buying from our store.
